Today we all ask ourselves, "Why are we doing this". What truly inspires us to do things?
What truly even counts as "Doing Something". The act of doing is a inflicting a visible change in reality.
Such things include movement, as the matter of your body moves according. So does that mean the simple action
of tapping your foot is doing something? Yet, we say things like sitting around and lying down are "Doing Nothing".
Yet, when we lie down and or sit down idly, we are still indeed doing something. We are breathing, we are looking,
blinking. Our brains shoot information all across our neurons and our blood cells work away to provide energy to
us. So are we really doing nothing? No. Every single bit of our lives is spent doing something. There truly is never
"A waste of time". No matter what you may do or think, our bodies are doing something important. That is why we are
doing things. They are important.I really recommend checking out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">video</a>.
It's a great inspiration to us all.
